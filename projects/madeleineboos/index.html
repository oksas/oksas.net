					<h1>Madeleine Boos</h1>
					<p>Website for local Tucson architect Madeleine Boos. Madeleine and I collaborated on the design to produce something that was more modern than her previous site and provided a streamlined user experience.</p>
					<p>I ended up writing my own tiny "library" for the site's photo galleries using vanilla JavaScript, as some of the other options I had tried (<a href="http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/">slick</a>, <a href="http://flickity.metafizzy.co/">Flickity</a>), while generally excellent, were unable to give me the behavior that I needed: to display each image in the gallery at as large a size as possible within the viewport while maintaining the image's aspect ratio. This was crucial for Madeleine's site because the images she had collected over time for her projects carried no guarantees of uniform size or horizontal/vertical orientation. I also built responsive, viewport size-based lazy-loading into the galleries, and a nifty little custom loading icon thrown in there too.</p>
					<p>Built in WordPress with HTML, CSS (Sass), and JavaScript.</p>
